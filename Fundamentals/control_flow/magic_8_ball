# The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
# Write a Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

# import random will provide a random answer everytime
import random

# set variables
name = input("What is your name?")
question = input("What's your question?")
print(name, "asks:", question, "Magic 8-Ball's answer:")

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)
#print(random_number)

# implement control flow using if/elif/else to assign different answers
# for each randomly generated value
if random_number == 1:
    print("Yes - Definitely")
