# You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

# Set initial variables
hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

# set variable total_price and calculate total price
total_price = 0
for price in prices:
  total_price += price
print(total_price)

# find average price
average_price = total_price/len(prices)
print("Average Haircut Price: £{0}".format(round(average_price,2)))

# owner wants to reduce her prices by £5. Use list comprehension to reduce each price by £5

new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]
print(new_prices)

# calculate revenue using prices and last week variable
total_revenue = 0
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]
print("Total Revenue is £", total_revenue)

# calculate the average daily revenue
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7
print("The average daily revenue is £", average_daily_revenue)

# create an additional list that one includes haircuts under £30

cuts_under_30 = [hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(prices)) if new_prices[i] < 30]
print(cuts_under_30)
