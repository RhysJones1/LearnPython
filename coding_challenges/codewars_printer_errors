*** In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.
The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...
Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.
You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.
The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z. ***

# by starting with the end in mind, we know that we need to present
# number of errors over the total
# define these outputs as errors and run a for loop: for every character above m add 1
def printer_error(s):
    no_of_errors = 0
    total = len(s)
    for i in s:
        if i > "m":
            no_of_errors += 1
    return str(no_of_errors) + "/" + str(total)
